**Here are some of the games I have worked on, enjoy!**

Step into the electric-blue crocs of Fladnag the Wizard and escape the monster-infested Cave! <br>
Play in full screen for best experience.<br>
**A bit of lore:** <br>
Fladnag, a lightning wizard, wears rubber crocs to insulate himself from the ground!<br>
That is, when he bothers to lower himself to the ground, as he is usually too arrogant for walking!<br>
Also, Fladnag is ambidextrous and loves to show it off, watch closely as he swiftly switches his staff from one hand to the other!
